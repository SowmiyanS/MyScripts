# My Scripts
This repo will host my scripts.

### addcert.sh
A bash script to install certificate to chrome and other browsers that uses db to store certificates.

### c.sh
A simple bash script to automatically connect to USB tethering by directly editing the `/etc/network/interfaces` file.
Requires `sudo` privelages.

### Notes for me:
#### git push origin main
To push to gitlab
#### git push origin2 main
To push to github
